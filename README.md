Hello!ðŸ‘‹ This project showcases my version of the Multidiversos ONG organization's website âœ…, where I have tackled several important aspects to enhance user experience, accessibility, and site performance âš¡.

Project Objectives ðŸŽ¯

- Accessibility Improvement: I developed an accessibility component that allows users to adjust text size according to their personal preferences. Additionally, I added a button to change the site's contrast to black and white, which can improve readability for certain users with specific needs.

- Performance Optimization: I made the site load faster by using lazy loading. Basically, this means that elements like images or videos are loaded only when the user needs them, which makes the page appear quicker and feel smoother, especially on devices with slow connections.

- Code Structure: I optimized the site's structure and styles to enhance its aesthetics and usability while following web accessibility standards. This ensures that the site is easier to use for a variety of users.

- Responsive Design: I designed the site to smartly adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring an optimal user experience in any browsing environment, whether on desktop computers, tablets, or mobile phones.

- SEO Improvements: I implemented optimization techniques to improve the site's visibility in search engines. This includes keyword optimization, proper content structuring, and generating quality backlinks to increase domain authority and improve search engine rankings.
